# Codex Scripts

Utility scripts used by Codex skills/runbooks.

These stay in-repo by default (not installed into `~/.codex`).

## Included

- `scripts/install-codex` — Sync `skills/vi-*` into `~/.codex/skills/`.
- `scripts/ralph-loop` — External Ralph loop runner for Codex (`codex exec` per iteration to keep context fresh).
