# Codex

Codex-specific resources live under `codex/`.

- `codex/skills/`: Codex skills (`SKILL.md`) with `vi-` prefix.
- `codex/runbooks/`: Markdown runbooks (how-to guides and operational checklists).
- `codex/scripts/`: Utility scripts referenced by skills/runbooks (not installed by default).

Install skills into `~/.codex/skills` by running `scripts/install-codex`.
