# Codex Skills

Codex skills live in `skills/` and are installed into `~/.codex/skills/`.

- Skill folders are named exactly after their `name:` in `SKILL.md`.
- All skills in this repo are namespaced with `vi-` to avoid collisions.

Install (full sync, overwrites `~/.codex/skills/vi-*`):

```bash
./scripts/install-codex
```
