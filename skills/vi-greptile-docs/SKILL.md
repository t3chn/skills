# Greptile Docs

Use the bundled references harvested from https://www.greptile.com/docs. Prefer citing the reference files when answering.

## Workflow

1. Identify the topic (code review, MCP v2, API, integrations, self-hosting, security).
2. Open `references/index.md` to locate the relevant page URL and title.
3. Read the matching file in `references/pages/` and extract the exact steps, options, or constraints.
4. If details are missing or outdated, fetch the live doc page and update references if requested.

## Notes

- References are ASCII-normalized snapshots of the docs.
- Do not invent endpoints or config keys; only answer from references or live docs.
