# Overview - What is Greptile?

URL: https://www.greptile.com/docs/introduction

Greptile is an AI code review agent that automatically reviews every pull request with complete understanding of your codebase.
Unlike traditional linters that check files in isolation, Greptile builds a graph of your entire repository to understand how changes affect the whole system.

## How it works

Connects to your repository

Install the GitHub/GitLab app and select repos. Greptile builds a complete graph of your codebase - every function, class, and dependency.

Reviews PRs automatically

On every pull request, Greptile analyzes changes with full context. Posts findings in ~3 minutes as PR comments with suggested fixes.

Learns from your team

Your / reactions and replies teach Greptile what matters. After 2-3 weeks, it stops commenting on things you dont care about.
