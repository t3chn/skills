# MCP Overview

The Greptile MCP server lets AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot) access your code review data directly. Instead of switching to GitHub or the Greptile dashboard, you can fetch comments, apply fixes, and manage coding patterns from your editor.

## What You Can Do

* **Fetch PR comments** - Get unaddressed Greptile feedback for any PR
* **Apply suggested fixes** - Comments often include code suggestions you can apply directly
* **Search feedback patterns** - Find recurring issues across all your reviews
* **Manage coding standards** - View and create your teams custom context patterns
* **Check review status** - See which comments are addressed before merging
