# Introduction

URL: https://www.greptile.com/docs/api-reference/introduction

Greptile indexes large repos and then answers hard questions about them in natural language. Think of it as an **AI expert on your codebase** , available as an API.
Example queries:

1. How does auth work in this codebase?
2. Generate a comment for this PR with codebase context
3. How would I add pagination to the `/retrieve` endpoint?

You can use the API in many ways:

1. Integrate with **Slack** to answer codebase questions.
2. Integrate with **Sentry** to enrich alerts with codebase context, diagnoses, and resolution steps.
3. Integrate with **GitHub** to review PRs and comment on new issues.

```
We offer a growing list of [first-party integrations](https://app.greptile.com/login), or you can use the API to build your own.
