# Frontend Design (High-Aesthetic UI)

Guide creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic “AI slop” aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this unforgettable? What’s the one thing someone will remember?

**Critical**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

If the work spans multiple steps, use `update_plan` to track progress, but keep the UI cohesive to the chosen direction.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial/Inter; opt for distinctive, characterful choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prefer CSS-first for static HTML. Use a motion library when appropriate. Focus on a few high-impact moments (e.g., a well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals) over scattered micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space *or* controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects/textures: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

Never use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families, clichéd color schemes (especially purple gradients on white), predictable layouts/patterns, or cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, and different aesthetics. Avoid converging on the same “safe” choices across generations.

**Important**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with deliberate effects and animation choreography. Minimalist/refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle detail.

Remember: you are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don’t hold back — commit to a distinctive vision and execute it fully.
